# Studio Jiggly

A shitty mouse jiggler for boring corporate jobs.

## What it does

- Pretends to be a totally legit Lenovo mouse
- Jiggles that shit
- I literally have no idea what I'm supposed to say here, it's a mouse jiggler. You get it.

## How to use

- Don't ask me, if you know how to build it, build it. If you don't, don't.
- And also, don't ask me how to use it.
